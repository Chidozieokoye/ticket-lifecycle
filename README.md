<p>
When you create a ticket as an end user, you submit a support request by selecting a help topic, providing details about the issue, and including any necessary attachments. This ticket is then logged into the system, assigned to the appropriate department or agent, and tracked for resolution
</p>

<h2>Observe the ticket properties</h2>

</p>
<p>
When you observe the ticket properties, you review key details such as ticket status, priority, assigned agent, department, and timestamps for creation and updates. This helps track the progress of the request, ensuring it is handled efficiently and within the defined service level

<h2>Set the ticket properties</h2>

</p>
<p>
When you set the ticket properties, you define or modify key aspects of the ticket, such as its status, priority, assigned agent, or department, to ensure it is routed and managed appropriately. This customization helps to organize the workflow, track progress, and meet response and resolution timelines effectively.

<h2>Work the ticket to completion</h2>

</p>
<p>
When you work the ticket to completion, you actively engage with the issue by investigating, troubleshooting, and collaborating with the relevant teams or users to find a resolution. Once the problem is resolved, you update the ticket with solutions, mark it as closed, and ensure all necessary documentation is completed.
