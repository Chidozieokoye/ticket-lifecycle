<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This setup begins with creating a support ticket, which serves as a record of an issue or request submitted by a user. Once the ticket is generated, its properties, such as priority level, department assignment, and status, are observed to understand its current state. The next step involves modifying ticket properties as needed, including reassigning it to the appropriate agent or team and updating its urgency. The ticket is then actively worked on by the assigned agent, involving communication with the user, troubleshooting, and implementing a solution. Finally, once the issue is resolved, the ticket is marked as completed or closed, ensuring that it is properly documented within the osTicket system. Please watch video demonstration below for more insight.<br />

<p>
In this step, I generated a new support ticket within the osTicket system. This could either be initiated by a user submitting a request through the client portal or by me manually creating the ticket on the user's behalf. The ticket contains key details, such as the issue description, priority level, assigned department, and requester information. These elements are crucial for tracking and managing the resolution process efficiently.

<h2>Observe the ticket properties</h2>

<p>
In the lab, I observed the ticket properties by thoroughly reviewing and analyzing the ticket’s specific details, such as its status, priority level, description, assigned team members, and any other relevant information. This step allowed me to gain a clear understanding of the ticket’s current situation, ensuring that the next actions I took were informed and aligned with its requirements.

<h2>Set the ticket properties</h2>

</p>
<p>
In this step, I set the ticket properties, and modify key aspects of the ticket, such as its status, priority, assigned agent, and department. This ensures that the ticket is routed and managed correctly. By customizing these properties, I help organize the workflow, track progress, and ensure response and resolution timelines are met efficiently.

<h2>Work the ticket to completion</h2>

</p>
<p>
Here I worked the ticket to completion, I actively engage with the issue by investigating, troubleshooting, and collaborating with the relevant teams or users to find a resolution. Once I’ve resolved the problem, I update the ticket with the solution, mark it as closed, and make sure all necessary documentation is completed.
